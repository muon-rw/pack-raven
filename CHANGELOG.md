# Changelog

We record notable changes to packraven here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and packraven uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Can now build and publish Modrinth packs, alongside CurseForge or on their own. Set the Modrinth project in Pack settings and add a Modrinth token in App settings to get started
- packraven tries very very hard to find Modrinth's equivalent copy of each mod and pack, if one exists.
- In a pack on Modrinth, mods only Modrinth hosts go into packraven's own mod list like CurseForge mods, instead of in git
- Warning list for mods which are on CF but not Modrinth; you can override files you have permission to share inside the Modrinth pack, and leave the rest out of it.
- Ship every openly licensed file at once, or everything by an author who gave you permission, including their mods you add later

### Changed
- Updated the pack list format version. Everyone working on the pack needs this version or newer, and on older versions you'll be asked to update before opening a pack built with a newer packraven version.

### Fixed
- Failing to find Fabric install even after you'd launched the instance from CurseForge
- BCC detection on older and newer versions

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-28

### Changed
- packraven now records a format version in mods.lock.json. If a newer version of packraven wrote the mod list you're trying to use, we'll prompt you to update before changing anything

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added
- Sign in to Minecraft right from the Run view

### Changed
- Launching a client now requires a Microsoft sign-in with an account that owns Java Edition (Mojang requires this).
- Test servers now use the `online-mode` from your pack's server.properties instead of packraven overriding it

### Removed
- Offline test runs, along with the "Offline username" pack setting and the "Run test servers in online mode" app setting

### Fixed
- The browser said you were signed in even when Minecraft refused the sign-in
- An expired Microsoft sign-in now signs you out with a clear message, instead of silently falling back to an offline run
- Fixed a potential issue on Windows introduced in packraven 0.1.9, where packraven could run out of space to store credentials

## [0.1.9] - 2026-10-27
### Fixed
- Reduced number of permission prompt popups on MacOS.
- Note: Until packraven is officially signed (it costs money), you'll still have security warnings when installing

## [0.1.8] - 2026-10-26

### Added
- Warning in Changes when packraven can't watch the pack folder
- Once CurseForge approves a jar you uploaded, packraven picks it up within about a minute and clears its "not on CurseForge" warning

### Changed
- Clicking on a mod name in "Browse" view now renders the description in-app rather than opening a browser window
- Cleaner layout for subviews (descriptions/changelog) in Mods and Browse
- Improved responsiveness to changes from external git
- Reduced performance impact (~33%) of background scanning for changes

### Fixed
- Mod descriptions/changelog text rendering in tiny boxes with lots of space available at larger window sizes
- Mod list could stay out of date if the file watcher missed a change; packraven now re-checks the mods folder when you switch back to it
- Background `git status` could make your own git commands fail with "index.lock: File exists"

## [0.1.7] - 2026-10-26
### Added
- "Stop Tracking" + warning for when `.gitignored` files are still tracked

### Changed
- Template gitignore now also ignores `.bak.n` files (JEI)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-10-26

### Added
- Ability to create datapacks/resourcepacks targeting a file when viewing inside a mod
- Side-by-side view panes! Right click a tab on the left to open more than one at a time. 

### Fixed
- Pulling remote mod changes on Windows always saying you had local mod changes, even if you didn't.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-25
### Added
- Individual rows in git view can now be unstaged
- Git diff windows can now be scrolled horizontally
- Images now show their before/after state in the git view, rather than a binary file warning
- Added Find in Files/Find and Replace in Files (Ctrl+Shift+F/Ctrl+Shift+H)
- Added Bulk Rename Files
- Added Quick Format (Alt+Shift+F in editor)

### Changed
- Disabled mods can now be enabled while the test client is running

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-21
### Added
- Can now add JVM flags and arguments for test runs of the client and server, under Pack settings -> Test runs, or for every pack under App settings -> Java. These are not shipped.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-20
### Fixed
- File editor's view pane jumping around to incorrect locations when typing at certain window sizes

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-20
### Added
- Improved search within log view, adding jump-to and surrounding lines.
- Java settings list the Javas packraven finds on this computer (CurseForge, JAVA_HOME, PATH, installed JDKs, IntelliJ, Gradle, Prism and Modrinth), so you pick one instead of typing a path
- When no Java of a version a pack needs is installed, packraven offers to download Oracle GraalVM for it
- Test runs fall back to any installed Java of the right version when CurseForge hasn't installed one or it wasn't detected
- You can launch and kill the test client from Mods, and start, restart and stop the test server from Server
- Server and Run tell you when the test server stops on its own, such as when a mod crashes it
- If the test server takes too long to stop, Stop server in the Server view turns into Kill server

### Changed
- Renamed the Test view to Run

### Fixed
- Mod version locks set in packraven now properly lock in Curseforge
- Opening or refreshing an instance in CurseForge no longer clears locks you only set in packraven

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-20

### Added
- Mod updates and installs can be queued while others download
- Queued mod changes can be cancelled (cancelling one row cancels everything you started with it)
- Mods can be added while the test client runs, and load on its next launch

### Changed
- Join server is now unticked by default, and saves your choice when you leave Test
- The previous run's logs are cleared when you start a test server or client
- Test start buttons wait for mod changes to finish
- Unavailable mod controls now say why on hover

### Fixed
- Launching a client without Join server showed the box ticked
- Mods list missed changes from outside packraven (CurseForge app, git pull), hiding update flags. Check for updates now reloads it too
- Rail showed a spinner next to the status dot of a busy view

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added
- packraven can now keep itself up to date
- Mods tab: browse CurseForge and install with dependencies
- Update, roll back, lock, disable and remove mods, one-at-a-time or in bulk
- Review pending updates and their changelogs before Update all
- Resource packs, shaders and data packs can now be disabled
- Mod version locks now sync automatically with the CurseForge app
- Server Mods tab: Renamed to Server, added `server.properties` editor, JVM flag and arg presets
- Client and server publish uploads can now be renamed
- Pack version can now be edited from the rail
- Added Microsoft sign-in for test clients and online test servers. **NOTE: This doesn't work until Mojang approves our API access request. Hopefully soon!** 
- Can now horizontally resize panes in Files, Git and Test

### Changed
- Mods is now the default view
- Test servers now require accepting the Minecraft EULA
- Offline test servers now only accept local connections (for Mojang license compliance)
- Publishing is blocked while two versions of one mod are enabled (CurseForge rejects manifests with these)

### Fixed
- Java detection for CurseForge's new install folders
- Mod updates skip jars Minecraft is currently holding open instead of stopping partway
- Failed downloads will retry up to three times
